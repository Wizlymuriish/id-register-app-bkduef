The church established key institutions like the PCEA Kikuyu Hospital, founded in 1908, and developed its Presbyterian church government with the institution of the Presbytery in 1920. The PCEA has grown significantly, playing a vital role in Kenya's social, medical, and educational landscape through its extensive work. \nEarly Beginnings & Missionaries\n1889-1891: Initial plans for the mission were made by Scottish figures Sir William Mackinnon and Mr. Alexander Low Bruce. \n1891: Missionaries, including Thomas Watson, arrived in Kibwezi and established the East African Scottish Mission. \n1892: The first temporary church and school were founded in Kibwezi by Dr. James Stewart. \n1898-1899: Due to malaria, the mission moved to Dagoretti and then to Thogoto, becoming the Church of Scotland Mission. \nInstitutional Development & Governance\n1907-1908: Dr. John W. Arthur arrived, leading to the opening of Hunter Memorial Hospital (now PCEA Kikuyu Hospital) in 1908. \n1920: A formal church government was established, with Elders ordained and Parish Sessions formed, leading to the institution of the Presbytery of British East Africa. \n1935: Pastors began training at St Paul's United Theological College. \nGrowth & Challenges\n1940s: The church faced division over the issue of female circumcision, leading to some members breaking away. \n1956: The church unified again after separating into European and African wings earlier. \nPresent Day: The PCEA has grown into a major denomination with a strong emphasis on community welfare through its educational, medical, and charitable works.
